# Pitch Perfect
## A voice modulation app

**NOTE: This project has been archived.**

This was an iOS app that allowed users to record their voices and later, play back the voice recording - with different voice modulations and playback speeds e.g. a slow Darth Vader voice and a fast, high-pitched 'chipmunk voice'.

It presented two views to the user - one for recording and one for playback. The audio functionality was accomplished using the [AVFoundation][1] framework and it's [AVAudioEngine][2] class.

The app was written in Swift 3.
